# Shortcuts

<div align='center'><img src="./media/header.png" style="height: 150px"></img></div>

This Repo is a selection of useful shortcuts for both MacOS and Windows. Each section is divided in two parts Operational System Shortcuts and VS Code Shortcuts. Is true that google will have a million articles with shortcuts and features for MacOS, Windows and VS Code. However, this repo is based on the shortcuts used through Mission Ready Level 4 and 5 lessons. So you might relate with the solutions they bring to your daily needs on that matter.

It's a ongoing repo to help gather all those shortcuts. So eventually the list will grow and change for a better layout when we see fit. That said, if you want to contribute or if you spot any mistake flick me a message and we can collaborate to fix and make it even better.
