# Shortcuts

<div align='center'><img src="./media/header.png" style="height: 150px"></img></div>

This Repo is a selection of useful shortcuts for both MacOS and Windows. Each section is divided in two parts Operational System Shortcuts and VS Code Shortcuts. Is true that google will have a million articles with shortcuts and features for MacOS, Windows and VS Code. However, this repo is based on the shortcuts used through Mission Ready Level 4 and 5 lessons. So you might relate with the solutions they bring to your daily needs on that matter.

It's a ongoing repo to help gather all those shortcuts. So eventually the list will grow and change for a better layout when we see fit. That said, if you want to contribute or if you spot any mistake flick me a message and we can collaborate to fix and make it even better.

# Other shortcut sources

One of my favourite source for shortcuts is DevHints, it covers not only shortcuts but also give cheatsheets on many development languages like CSS, HTML, etc.

And since I've started on the cheatsheets topic another one is OverAPI, it's essentially a collection of links made into a cheatsheet for several developers languages.
