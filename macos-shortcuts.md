## Features

### Mission Control

![Mission Control Example](./media/mission-control.png)
Mission Control Allows you to see all the applications you have open as a miniature on one single screen (space). Common shortcut for it is F3

$\textcolor{greenYellow}{\textsf{Ctrl + Arrow Up}}$ -> Open Mission Control (Same as F3)

$\textcolor{greenYellow}{\textsf{Ctrl + Arrow Left}}$ -> Navigate to the next Desktop (Space) on focused screen

$\textcolor{greenYellow}{\textsf{Ctrl + Arrow Right}}$ -> Navigate to the previous Desktop (Space) on focused screen

$\textcolor{greenYellow}{\textsf{Ctrl + Arrow Down}}$ -> Hide all applications but the one in focus

The plus button on the right top will allow you to create new Desktops / Spaces that might be helpful for who is struggling with a single screen.

However, still highly recommend a second screen.

The Mission Control Desktops (Spaces) can definetly help you managing multiple tasks.
For example, you can have one with Teams and the video class open, another one with VS Code and another one with your browser (localhost) of your current exercise/project.
